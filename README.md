## Emberpress

**Want to try EmberPress? [Click Here](http://emberpress.eviltrout.com)**

This is a clone of the popular [Letterpress](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/letterpress-word-game/id526619424?mt=8)
game. It is meant to show off the client side powers of the [EmberJS](http://emberjs.org)
framework and was originally created for [Toronto EmberJS](http://torontoemberjs.com)
meetup by [Evil Trout](http://eviltrout.com).

Mucho thanks go out Loren Brichter for the inspiration. Thanks to the EmberJS 
team for making an awesome framework that makes client side development fun.
